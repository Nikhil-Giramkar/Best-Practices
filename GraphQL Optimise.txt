Improve performace?

1. Redirect to cached data.
In some cases, a query requests data that already exists in the client store under a different key. 
A very common example of this is when your UI has a list view and a detail view that both use the same data. 
-----------------------------------

2. Prefetching is one of the easiest ways to make your application's UI feel a lot faster with Apollo Client. 
Prefetching simply means loading data into the cache before it needs to be rendered on the screen. 
Essentially, we want to load all data required for a view as soon as we can guess that a user will navigate to it.
-----------------------------------

3. Batching involves merging multiple queries into a single request to minimize the number of network round trips required. 
This technique is useful when retrieving related data for multiple records. 
-----------------------------------

4. Caching, on the other hand, involves storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the number of queries required to fetch data. 
By caching data, subsequent requests for the same data can be served from memory, improving query times and reducing the server load.
-----------------------------------

5. Pagination
To handle over-fetching issues, pagination and field selection can be used to only retrieve the necessary data. 
By specifying the exact fields needed in a query, the amount of data retrieved can be reduced, improving query performance.
-----------------------------------

6. Use DataLoaders
DataLoader is an open-source utility library used with GraphQL to implement batched data fetching and caching.
 It is designed to load data efficiently from a database, it also helps to avoid redundant or unnecessary data fetching. 
 By using DataLoader, it is possible to retrieve data more efficiently and reduce the number of round trips to the database, 
Therefore improving the performance of GraphQL queries.
